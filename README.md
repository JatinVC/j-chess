# J Chess
## Basic chess game by JatinVC

got bored, fun little project
Goals:
- create a multiplayer chess game where people can play against each other
- Implement Algebraic notation for move tracking
- FEN notation being used to set the pieces on the chess board
- Back-end to start a new game and matchmaking (or just create a room and allow one other person to join the room, whatever)
- socket server for the game itself
- Use docker compose to network between services (also just easier to deploy lol)
